# CriticalPath

A javascript micro-library to precisely design the resources loading pipeline.


## Motivation

The browsers out there are very smart speaking about loading assets. They handle all the low-level stuff for you try to load async all the resources.
The problem here is that the browsers are very optimistics about bandwidth. They try to use all the band without worry about the user.
The browsers are very smart but they cannot really know what the user want to see immediately and what can be delayed.
The designer can and this is the reason why of this little tool.


## How it works

It a designer responsibility to define which are the resources the browser should load because they are very important for the user experience.
With this little library the designer can precisely define the exact loading sequence, based on the user journey the designer is actually envision.
